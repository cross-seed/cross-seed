# Writing code

1. Download VS Code. it has typescript support out of the box, but any ide will
   do. recommend downloading a typescript plugin if needed
2. clone repo
3. open repo in vs code
4. run npm install
5. start coding :)

the code is in `/src`. `cmd.js` is the entrypoint, `pipeline.js` is the
interesting high level functions (doRss, etc...)

# Build and Run

`npm run build` will compile the typescript files into javascript files in /dist
`npm run watch` will compile, then incrementally compile when files change the
`cross-seed` command is an alias for `node dist/cmd.js`, as in
`node dist/cmd.js daemon` but it's annoying to use the cross-seed alias while
developing so i use a lot of ctrl-R with fzf

# Testing

I keep a `config.js` that points to
`{ torrentDir: "./input", outputDir: "./output" }` and put some torrent files in
`./input` I usually run in search mode because it's the simplest form of
cross-seed and most work applies to it.

## testing daemon mode

have three terminals open, one for npm run watch, one for keeping the cross-seed
daemon open, and one for curling to localhost:2468

## testing direct injection

mostly i stick with `--save` (the default i think) usually i use docker to run
whichever client. you could install it yourself though I have a gitignored
docker_compose.yml that keeps track of all of the clients but i only run them
one at a time

# Releasing

```
git checkout master
git pull
npx np
```

If there's a new typescript file, it'll tell you it won't be included. That's
correct - the typescript files in `src` aren't included, but they compile down
to javascript files in `dist` which _are_ included.

It'll ask you if you want to increment patch, minor, or major version. I think
I'd say _don't bump major_ unless we've talked about it in `#development`. Minor
vs patch is kind of meaningless but mostly patch for fixes and minor for
features.

Then it'll do a bunch of compiling, etc. Eventually it will open a tab in your
browser asking you to create a release. Then you can just click the Submit
button and you're done.

If you ever fuck up (often due to forgetting the github release), just release
again with a `patch` version bump. no big deal
