# cross-seed: Fully-automatic, no false positives

`cross-seed` is an app designed to help you download torrents that you can cross
seed based on your existing torrents. It is designed to match conservatively to
minimize manual intervention.

`cross-seed` can inject the torrents it finds directly into your torrent client.
Currently, the supported clients are

-   rTorrent
-   qBittorrent
-   Transmission
-   Deluge

If your client isn't supported, `cross-seed` will download a bunch of torrent
files to a folder you specify. After that, I recommend using
[AutoTorrent2](https://github.com/JohnDoee/autotorrent2) to do the last-mile
delivery into your client.

## Requirements

-   [Node >= 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

    help)
