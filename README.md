# cross-seed: Fully-automatic cross-seeding

`cross-seed` automatically finds and downloads torrents that are "cross seeds"
existing across your other trackers, all based on your existing torrents and/or
data. It is designed to match comprehensively while minimizing manual
intervention, but it's also highly configurable to match your preferences.

## Torrent Client Integration

`cross-seed` can inject new torrents it finds directly into your torrent client.

If you use another client we do not currently support, and would like to help
integrate it into `cross-seed`,
[please open an issue here on GitHub to discuss it with us](https://github.com/cross-seed/cross-seed/issues).

## Requirements

- [Node >= 24](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Indexers that support Torznab or an tracker/indexer manager such as
  Prowlarr/Jackett (Prowlarr is preferred)
