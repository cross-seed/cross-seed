# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## What can I do about `error parsing torrent at http://…`?

This means that the jacket download link didn't resolve to a torrent file. It's
possible you got rate-limited so you might want to try again in a day or more.
Otherwise, just ignore it. There's nothing cross-seed will be able to do to fix
it.
